### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pablo. 

I work as an Analyst at the [EBRD's Office of the Chief Economist](https://www.ebrd.com/what-we-do/economic-research-and-data/office-of-the-chief-economist.html). Previously, I was a pre-doctoral research assistant working with Professors [Miguel Almunia](https://malmunia.github.io/) and [Claudia Hupkau](https://sites.google.com/view/claudiahupkau/home), and an intern at the [Bank of Spain](https://www.bde.es/investigador/en/). I studied economics at the [LSE](https://www.lse.ac.uk/) and [UC3M](https://www.uc3m.es/home).

My work leverages large-scale household surveys and administrative datasets to answer policy-oriented research questions in the realm of applied microeconomics. I also design interactive visualizations tools to maximize the impact of key research products and, in my free time, to tell data stories about whatever I deem interesting.
