### hey! ðŸ‘‹

i'm **pablo**.

i do applied microeconomic and policy research at a [multilateral development bank](https://www.ebrd.com/sites/Satellite?c=Content&cid=1395317980748&pagename=EBRD%2FContent%2FContentLayout). previously, i worked in academia as a pre-doctoral research assistant. i studied economics at the [LSE](https://www.lse.ac.uk/) and [UC3M](https://www.uc3m.es/home).

i have +3 years of experience leveraging large-scale household surveys, administrative and geospatial datasets to answer policy-oriented research questions. i also design [interactive visualizations tools](/projects) to maximize the impact of key products and, in my free time, to tell data stories about whatever i deem interesting.
