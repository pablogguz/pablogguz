### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pablo. 

I work as an Analyst at the EBRD's Office of the Chief Economist. Previously, I was a pre-doctoral research assistant working with Miguel Almunia and Claudia Hupkau, and an intern at the Bank of Spain. I studied economics at the LSE and UC3M.

My work leverages large-scale household surveys and administrative datasets to answer policy-oriented research questions in the realm of applied microeconomics.

I also design interactive visualizations tools to maximize the impact of key research products and, in my free time, to tell data stories about whatever I deem interesting.
